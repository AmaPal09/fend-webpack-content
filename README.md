# Webpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

If you want to follow along with the course, you will start from the master and switch to the appropriate numbered branches of this repo as needed. The branches are:
- [0-initial-setup](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/0-initial-setup)
- [1-install-webpack](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/1-install-webpack)
- [2-add-webpack-entry](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/2-add-webpack-entry)
- [3-webpack-output-and-loaders](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/3-webpack-output-and-loaders)
- [4-webpack-plugins](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/4-webpack-plugins)
- [5-webpack-mode](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/5-webpack-mode)
- [6-webpack-for-convenience](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/6-webpack-for-convenience)

Each one is a step along the path to creating a fully functional webpack setup. In each branch, there will be a documentation file that lists out the steps taken in that branch (each step should also match to a git commit if you look at the history) which you can use as a checklist when setting up your own projects.

## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo down to your computer:

```
git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/webpack-express.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in index.js

### Step 0:
npm install
npm start

### Step 1:
-Install packages
``` npm i webpack@4.35.3```
``` npm i webpack-cli@3.3.5```
-Following dependencies were added to package.json
``` "webpack": "^4.43.0",```
``` "webpack-cli": "^3.3.11" ```
-To the scripts section of package.json add
```  "build": "webpack" ```
-Add a devDependencies block
```
"devDependencies":{
  "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0",
}
```
-Create new file webpack.config.js
-To webpack.config.js add
```
const path = require("path")
const webpack = require("webpack")
module.exports = {
}
```
-Execute
``` npm run build```

### Step 2:
-To the webpack.config.js add entry point in the module
```
module.exports = {
	entry: './src/client/index.js',
}
```
-Add client folder to source
-Add index.js file to client
-Add alert to index.js
``` alert('Hi there!');```
- ``` npm run build```
- Dist folder created in project folder
- main.js add to dist folder


### Step 3:
-Install babel to the developer version
``` npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader```
	-D will install these as development dependencies.

-Create a new babel config file .babelrc
-Config babel
``` { ‘presets’: ['@babel/preset-env'] } ```

-Add rules for using babel in webpack
```
module: {
            rules: [
                    {
                test: '/\.js$/',
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loader: "babel-loader"
                    }
            ]
    }
```

- Import js files in index.js
- Export from original file

- Add the bundled files to html

- Build again
``` npm run build ```

### Step 4:
-HTML plugin set up

-Install HTML plugin for dev dependencies
```
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
```
-Require the plugin at the top of webpack config file
```
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin")
```
-Set up the plugin by adding this section to the module.exports portion of the config file:
```
plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
        template: "./src/client/views/index.html",
        filename: "./index.html",
    })
]
```
- ** Remove dist folder and rebuild. **
Plugin addition successful when index.html file in the dist folder

-Remove all references to the scripts in the html file as they are added by webpack
-Reference correct files from server
	-In order to use the new html file being generated by webpack, tell express to serve that file. In the server/index.js file change the home route to point to the new files in the dist folder:
```
	app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	    res.sendFile('dist/index.html')
	})
```
	-The assets are all handled by webpack, so they are all going to come from the dist folder, so on the server side ensure server uses the correct path to the dist folder.
```
	app.use(express.static('src/client'))
	app.use(express.static('dist'))
```

- ** Error handling **
Error: typeerror cannot read property 'tap' of undefined htmlwebpackplugin
latest plugin was installed but webpack version is not the latest one.
Installed "html-webpack-plugin": "^3.2.0" instead

### Step 5
Mode setup

-Duplicate webpack.config.js and rename it to webpack.prod.js
    - Add mode in module.export as production
    ```
        mode: 'production'
    ```

-Rename webpack.config.js file webpack.dev.js
    -Add mode in module.export as dev and add a source map as dev tools
    ```
        mode: 'development',
        devtool: 'source-map',
    ```
-Add build modes in package.json to configure dev and prodcution mode
    ```
        "scripts": {
        "build-prod": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js",
        "build-dev": "webpack-dev-server  --config webpack.dev.js --open"
    },
    ```

### Step 6
Webpack convenience

- To clean the /dist folder before each build, so that only used files will be generated use clean-webpack-plugin
```
    npm install --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin
```

-Require it in the dev configuration and instantiate it
```
    const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');
```
    New instance in plugins
    ```
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    ```
